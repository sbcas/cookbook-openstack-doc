# cookbook-openstack-doc
Pull together all the OpenStack cookbook documentation into a searchable web site.

This is "built" whenever a merge goes into master. The builds are done in Travis-CI.

9/11/15 update, now that we have a spec on the books for doing config attributes differently, this project might need to be tweaked to go after better joining of the readme's and less focus on the attributes. 

4/19/16 update, need to look at new refactoring and see how to best pull together some doc updates.
